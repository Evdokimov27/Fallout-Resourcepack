-- V1.0 --

Major Update â–º Merging of all smaller development packs!!:
Packs:
  Fallout Paradise main	(Main pack featuring most texture sprites)
  Fallout Paradise Expansion (Previously the biggest file size "merger" pack)
  Walldeco (all posters)
  Items (Most custom modeled items, guns etc)
  Sounds (custom sound files)

Why?
  Until now we've tried to keep all but a single pack below 8mb so we could easily share it over discord.
  And we needed multiple packs since multiple people are working on content at the same time

Whats New:
  Now we're merging everything into the main pack and uploading it to mediafire, this will mean you only 
  need to download a single pack from now on (instead of both paradise + expansion + others).

  The version number reverts back to 1.0 for this release, and new updates will be coming at 0.05 increments
  (compared to 0.01 previously)

Additions:
  -Added animated eyes to zombie(testing purposes for npc's on the server)
  -Moved the animation template over to piglin (which will be the mob used for npc's on the server)
  -4 facial expressions added for Piglins named "Raider1" - 4
  -More animation test files (different eyes / mouth animations)
